Verium
=============

Setup
---------------------
Verium is the original Verium client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Verium transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

In order to help you to be able to sync as fast as possible we have implemented a bootstrap system explain in the documentation below

To download Verium, visit [vericoin.info](https://vericoin.info/verium-digital-reserve/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Verium on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/verium-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/veriumd` (headless)

### Windows

Download and execute "Verium_0.16_64bit.exe"

### OS X

Drag Verium_0.16_64bit.pkg to your applications folder, and then run Verium Wallet.

Bootstrap
---------------------
In order to speed up the download of the blockchain and to let you discover the full potential of the Verium Wallet, a bootstrap process is implemented in the Verium.

* You can launch it by different methods base on how you are using you wallet:
  - Command line: src/verium-cli bootstrap
  - UI: file > reload blockchain
