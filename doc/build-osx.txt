Mac OS X vericoind and qt build instructions
Laszlo Hanyecz <solar@heliacal.net>

See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building VeriCoin QT, the
graphical user interface.

This source is actively supported for 10.9 and above and tested up to 10.12 since apple switched to libc++ from libstdc++.  It can be built for 10.7-10.9 by changing -mmacosx-version-min=10.9 to -mmacosx-version-min=10.7 in lines 97-99 of vericoin-qt.pro.

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and
everything is available in /usr not just /Developer I think it comes on the DVD
but you can get the current version from http://developer.apple.com

1.  Download and install xcode from the app store.

2.  sudo xcode-select --install

3.  Download and install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

4. (for 10.7 Lion)
    Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf and uncomment "build_arch i386"

5.  Install dependencies from MacPorts

sudo port install boost db48 openssl miniupnpc minizip curl

6.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

git clone https://github.com/vericoin/vericoin.git

7.  Now you should be able to build headless vericoind, if building vericoin-qt skip to 8:

cd vericoin/src
make -f makefile.osx
Run:
  ./vericoind --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./vericoind -daemon # to start the vericoin daemon.
Run
  ./vericoind help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands

8. For qt builds:

sudo port install qrencode

9. Download and install qt 5.4.2 for Mac 

https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.4/5.4.2/qt-opensource-mac-x64-clang-5.4.2.dmg

Note: If you have Xcode 8+ you will need to edit line 15 of default_pre.prf in the Qt folder at 5.4/clang_64/mkspecs/features/mac 

from:
isEmpty($$list($$system("/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcrun 2>/dev/null"))): \
to:
isEmpty($$list($$system("/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcodebuild 2>/dev/null"))): \

10. To make qt 5.4.2 support new libc++ standard of macOS 9+ you will need to edit line 14 of the file qmake.conf in in the Qt folder at 5.4/clang_64/mkspecs/macx-clang

from:
QMAKE_MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 10.7
to:
QMAKE_MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 10.9

11. Run qtcreator in qt install folder and load vericoin via the vericoin-qt.pro file and click the build button
