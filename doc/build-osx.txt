Mac OS X vericoind build instructions
Laszlo Hanyecz <solar@heliacal.net>

See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building VeriCoin QT, the
graphical user interface.

Tested on 10.5 and 10.6 and 10.9.5 intel.  PPC is not supported because it's big-endian.

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and
everything is available in /usr not just /Developer I think it comes on the DVD
but you can get the current version from http://developer.apple.com

0.  Download and install xcode from the app store.
0a. If Xcode 5.X, go to Xcode->Preferences->Downloads and install Comand Line Tools.
    Otherwise, run 'sudo xcode-select --install' to install the command line tools.

1.  Download and install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

1a. (for 10.7 Lion)
    Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf and uncomment "build_arch i386"

2.  Install dependencies from MacPorts

sudo port install boost db48 openssl miniupnpc qt5-mac gcc49 wget

Optionally install qrencode (and set USE_QRCODE=1):
sudo port install qrencode

2a. You may also need to copy the qt5 makespec folder for macx-g++42 to macx-g++49 if it does not exist, then set the compilers in qmake.conf to gcc-mp-4.9 and g++-mp-4.9.

3.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

git clone https://github.com/vericoin/vericoin.git

4.  Now you should be able to build vericoind:

cd vericoin/src
make -f makefile.osx

Run:
  ./vericoind --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./vericoind -daemon # to start the vericoin daemon.
Run
  ./vericoind help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands
